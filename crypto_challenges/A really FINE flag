So this is a somewhat basic double encoding challenge. The first step is the string is base64 encoded. 
Once decoded you get the string: jpek{irgshmrk_mw_gvctxs_vmklx} . 
This is encoded with the Affine Cipher (hence the 'A really FINE flag' title) using the values a=1 and b=4.
I don't plan to give the values because there are online tools to easily bruteforce those values. 
Once decoded using that cipher, you get the flag flag{encoding_is_crypto_right}
